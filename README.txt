Hello everyone, this repository is about the case study I completed after I finished the Google Data Analytics Certficate. It involves the use of data analytics to drive informed decision making thus helping a bike-share company to maximize profits and generate more revenue. This PDF discusses the steps I took towards achieving that goal and it also includes both the link and workbook of the Tableau Visualization file.
